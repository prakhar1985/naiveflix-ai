> *"An AI that thinks every movie is Sci-Fi. We call that progress."*

This repo contains a fun and beginner-friendly workshop series where you teach AI to predict movie genres from plot summaries. Start with classic models like TF-IDF + Naive Bayes, and scale up to embeddings, GPUs, and OpenShift AI.

== 🔧 Environment Setup

To set up your RHEL or Fedora system for this workshop, use the dedicated automation repo:

➡️ https://github.com/prakhar1985/ai-lab-setup

That repo will:
- Create a Python virtual environment (`first-ai`)
- Install required packages (`jupyterlab`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc.)
- Launch JupyterLab for hands-on work

Run it like this:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/prakhar1985/ai-lab-setup
cd ai-lab-setup
bash setup.sh
source ~/first-ai/bin/activate
jupyter lab
----
